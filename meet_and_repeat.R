# BPRS data is taken from Davis (2002). The data has information about 40 male subjects randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Each subject was rated
# on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) measured before treatment began (week 0) and then at weekly intervals for eight weeks. The BPRS assesses
# the level of 18 symptom constructs such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; each of these is rated from one (not present) to seven
# (extremely severe). The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having schizophrenia.
