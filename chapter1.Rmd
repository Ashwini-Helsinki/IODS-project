*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*
This is 'Open data science' course. I am familier with R and R studio. I have used Git earlier but I am not confident enough to use it indepenently. 
I am interested in learning about data science and how Statistics can be conveyed to non-statisticians.
I was searching for a course not necessarily in Statistics but will talk about data science applicable for any field and some simple ways of learning and using Github.
The reviews of earlier students of this course encouraged me to enrol in this course.
